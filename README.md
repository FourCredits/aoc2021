## TODOs

- [x] Split Utils into different modules
- [x] Make a generic simulate function, akin to `Day11.simulateN`
- [x] Remove parsec dependency - I don't really need something that fancy
- [x] Add tuple sections as a project wide extension
- [x] Complete package.yaml stuff like author name, etc.
- [ ] Disable 'non-exhaustive pattern matching' error
- [ ] Split tests into different files
- [x] Finish Day 15
- [ ] Make Day 15 better - perhaps only use one data structure
