## TODOs

- [x] split Utils into different modules
- [x] make a generic simulate function, akin to `Day11.simulateN`
- [x] Remove parsec dependency - I don't really need something that fancy
- [ ] add tuple sections as a project wide extension
- [x] Complete package.yaml stuff like author name, etc.
- [ ] Disable 'non-exhaustive pattern matching' error
- [ ] split tests into different files
